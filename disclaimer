# CTF Challenge Response Solver

## Introduction

This repository contains code developed as part of a private program focused on cybersecurity (not my program) and ethical hacking. The code serves as a solution to a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge-and-response server.

## About the Challenge

The challenge protocol involves receiving a data offset value (DOV), decoding a challenge packet, constructing a response key, and capturing the flag by submitting the correct key to the server.

## Purpose

The purpose of sharing this code is to provide a resource for other students who are learning about hacking and participating in similar CTF challenges. By making this code available, I aim to contribute to the learning journey of aspiring cybersecurity enthusiasts.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Modify the code as necessary to adapt it to your own challenges or learning objectives.
5. Run the code and interact with the provided challenge-and-response server.
